# Butternut Squash with Fennel

### Ingredients
- extra virgin olive oil
- 1 stick butter
- 1 onion, chopped (or spring onions - 4 stalks)
- 1 large fennel bulb with “fern”
- 1 large butternut squash
- 2 large carrots
- 1/4 cup white wine or Zinfandel
- 1 box chicken broth 
- 1 can heavy cream

### Directions
1. Pour generous amount of olive oil to cover bottom of a stock pot. Add 1/2 stick butter. Heat over low-medium heat. Add chopped onion. Cook until translucent.
2. Clean fennel bulb and the fern (the fern is the top, finely-leafed portion of the fennel) under cold water and pat dry. Detach some fern from stems, discarding stems (they can be pithy). Chop bulb, discarding tough outer layer. Add chopped fennel bulb to onion and continue to sauté over low heat, stirring occasionally.
3. Peel squash and carrots. Cut squash into medium sized cubes; slice carrot.
4. Add approximately 1/2 teaspoon salt to pan (Kosher salt preferred), and sprinkle with pepper (use white pepper if available). Turn heat to medium, add ¼-1 cup wine to onion and fennel; cook until alcohol “burns off”, approximately 4 to 5 minutes.
5. Add carrot and squash to pot. Add 4 or 5 cans of chicken stock and remaining butter. Cover and bring to a slow boil.Chop reserved fennel fern. Add to pot.
6. Reduce to simmer, and cook until vegetables are very tender. (20 minutes)
7. Flavor with a dash of cayenne pepper, if preferred.
8. Remove soup from heat and puree with hand mixer/blender. Add cream.
9. Serve with crusty bread
