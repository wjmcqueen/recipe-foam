# Dutch Baby

### Ingredients
- ¾ cup milk
- ½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 1½ tablespoons sugar
- ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter (Try 2 tablespoons)
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinammon
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
- 1½ cups thinly sliced fresh fruit, of choice (peaches, nectarines, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, mangoes, etc.) or use sauteed apple slices.

### Directions
1. Fifteen minutes before baking preheat the oven to 450°; have a pie plate or oven-proof skillet ready.
2. Whisk together the milk, flour, eggs, sugar and vanilla; put the butter in the pie plate or skillet and place the pan in the oven just until the butter is melted; with a brush coat the rim and entire inside of the pan.
3. Slowly pour batter into hot pan; bake for 20 minutes; reduce heat to 350° and bake another 8-10 minutes, until pancake is well-browned; remove from oven and sieve confectioners' sugar over the top; serve immediately with fruit spooned into the center of the pancake. Alternatively, bake for 15mins at 425° and then down to 325° for 8-10 mins.
