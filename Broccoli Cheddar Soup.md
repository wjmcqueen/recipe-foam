# Broccoli Cheddar Soup

- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1/2 cup melted butter
- 1/2 cup flour
- 4 cups half-and-half
- 4 cups chicken stock or bouillon
- 1 pound fresh broccoli
- 2 cups carrots, julienned
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 16 ounces grated sharp cheddar

### Directions
1. Saute onion in butter. Set aside. Cook melted butter and flour using a whisk over medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Stir constantly and slowly add the half-and-half (this is called making a roux). Add the chicken stock whisking all the time. Simmer for 20 minutes.
2. Add the broccoli, carrots and onions. Cook over low heat until the veggies are tender for 20-25 minutes. Add salt and pepper. The soup should be thickened by now. Pour in batches into blender and puree. Return to pot over low heat and add the grated cheese; stir until well blended. Stir in the nutmeg and serve.
