Recipe from Ruth Reichl’s Gourmet Today
Prep Time: 15 min /Total Time: 30 min, Serves 4

Can I Get the Recipe Tip: Purée can be made, but not tossed with pasta, 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

### Ingredients
#### Arugula Puree
- 2 tablespoons pine nuts, lightly toasted and cooled 
- 5 oz baby arugula, coarsely chopped (7 cups) 
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
- 1/2 oz finely grated Pecorino Romano 
- 1 teaspoon salt 

#### Cherry Tomato Sauce
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed with side of a large knife 
- 1 1/2 lb cherry tomatoes (about 5 cups), trimmed if necessary 
- 3/4 teaspoon salt 
- 1 lb dried fettuccine (not made with egg) 

### Directions
1. Make Puree – Pulse pine nuts in a food processor until finely ground (be careful not to grind to a paste.) Add arugula, oil, cheese, and salt and pulse until almost smooth.
2. Make Tomato Sauce – Heat oil in a 1 inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook garlic, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Discard garlic. Add tomatoes and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are collapsed but not falling apart, 15 – 20 minutes.
3. Cook and Serve Pasta – Cook fettuccine in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling slated water until al dente. Drain pasta in a colander and return to pot. Add arugula puree and toss until well coated. Transfer to a platter or plates and top with tomato sauce.
