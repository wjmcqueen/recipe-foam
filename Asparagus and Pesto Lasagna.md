### Ingredients
#### Pesto
- 1 cup whole basil leaves
- 1 small garlic clove
- 1 Tbsp. pine nuts
- 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
- Pinch of salt

#### Lasagna
- 1/2 pound asparagus
- 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp. minced garlic
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1-1/2 cups mascarpone cheese
- 1 sheet fresh pasta or 4 lasagna noodles, cooked, rinsed, and coated with olive oil
- 1 cup grated fontina cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

### Directions
1. To make pesto: Combine first 5 ingredients in a food processor and blend.  (If too thick, add water or more olive oil.)  Season with salt and set aside.
2. To make lasagna:  Saut√© asparagus in olive oil over high heat for 4 minutes.  Add garlic, cook 1 minute, and season with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat.
3. Preheat over to 375.  Grease a small loaf pan (about 4in by 8in) with butter.  Combine mascarpone and pesto.  Cut pasta to fit dish and place enough noodles in pan to cover bottom; top with 1/3 cup fontina cheese, 1/3 of the asparagus, and 1/3 of the pesto mixture; then sprinkle with Parmesan.  Repeat layering two more times with remaining ingredients.  Cover with foil and bake 25 minutes.  Discard foil and continue baking 10 additional minutes.  Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.
