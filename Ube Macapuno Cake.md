# Ube Macapuno Cake

### Ingredients
#### Chiffon cake

{A}
- 2 1/4 cups cake flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

{B}
- 7 egg yolks (from large eggs)
- 1/2 cup vegetable/canola oil
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup (about 100g) grated ube (purple yam)
- 1 teaspoon ube flavouring
- 1/2 teaspoon violet food powder or violet gel paste

{C}
- 7 egg whites
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar

{D}
- 3/4 cup sugar

#### Frosting
- 2 cups whipping or thickened cream
- 1 250g package of cream cheese
- 1/2 cup white sugar (edit: added on 21/8)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 12 oz jar of macapuno (preserved coconut sport)

### Directions
#### Chiffon cake
1. Preheat oven to 170 degrees Celsius. Prepare two 9" round, 2 1/2" high pans by lining bottoms with baking paper. Do not grease.
2. In a large bowl, sift together {A} and combine well. Add in {B}. Beat with electric mixer or by hand just until smooth and well blended.
3. In a separate bowl, beat {C} on high speed until frothy. Gradually add in {D} and beat until stiff peaks are formed. Gradually and gently fold in egg whites into flour mixture until very well combined. Divide batter equally into prepared pans.
4. Bake for about 45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Invert pans into wire rackimmediately and cool completely.
5. Carefully run a thin knife around sides of pans to release cakes. Using a serrated knife, half each cake horizontally. Set aside one of the top halves for use later.

#### Frosting
1. Combine the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment and mix on medium speed until smooth. While the mixture is still whipping, slowly pour in the heavy cream. Continue whipping until the cream can hold a stiff peak. 

#### Assemble
1. Drain some of the syrup from the macapuno. I do this for fear that the cake will absorb the syrup and get soggy and also to prevent the cake from becoming too sweet.
2. Place one of the cake layers (bottom half of one of the cakes), cut side up on your serving plate or cake board. Spread and level some whipped cream onto the cake layer until it is about 1/4" thick. Scatter half of the macapuno on top of the whipped cream. 
3. Place second cake layer, cut side down on top of bottom cake layer. Spread whipped cream and remaining macapuno on top of second layer in the same manner as above. 
4. Top the cake with the third layer (cut side down). Spread frosting to cover top and sides of cake. (You don't have to put a lot, just enough for the cake crumbs to stick to it). Remember to leave some frosting for your borders.
5. Crumble the last cake half. (You actually only need to crumble about 3/4 of this cake piece. My suggestion is to leave the quarter for you to snack on!). If you do this with a food processor, you will get very fine crumbs which will look really neat on the cake. You can, however, crumble it by hand. Gently stick the crumbs to the cake top and sides until it is fully covered.
6. Using the remaining frosting, pipe out big rosettes around the cake's top edge.

## Alternate

### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups cake flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup ube (purple yam), cooked and finely grated
- 3/4 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup corn syrup
- 7 egg yolks, lightly beaten
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 7 egg whites
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 6 drops red food color
- 6 drops blue food coloring
- 1 (12 ounce) jar macapuno (coconut preserves)
- 1 cup evaporated milk, chilled
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 drop violet food coloring

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line bottoms of 3 - 9 inch pans with parchment paper, but do not grease. Mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
2. Place grated ube in a large bowl. Mix together 3/4 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla; gradually blend into ube until smooth. Blend in corn syrup, egg yolks, and oil. Beat in flour mixture until smooth; set aside.
3. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add sugar, then red and blue food coloring, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the center of cake bounces back when lightly tapped. Invert pans on a wire rack and let cool upside down. When cool, run a knife around the edges to loosen cake from pans. Fill between layers with coconut preserves, then frost top and sides with butter icing.
5. To make Butter Icing: Combine evaporated milk and 3/4 cup sugar. set aside. Cream butter until light and fluffy; gradually add sugar mixture, and continue beating to desired spreading consistency. Add food color, one drop at a time until desired tint is achieved.
